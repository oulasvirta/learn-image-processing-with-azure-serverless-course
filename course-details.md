In this lab, you will create and configure an auto-scaling image processing architecture using following Azure serverless services: _Computer Vision API, Function Apps, Logic Apps, Event Grid, Cosmos DB and Azure Storage_. 

At the end of this lab, you will have learned how to use a series of Azure Functions that independently scale and break down business logic to discrete components, use computer vision algorithms within an Azure Function to accurately detect license plates in car images at scale, provision and use Cosmos DB as a highly available NoSQL data store for processed data, create a Logic App that contains a workflow to export processed license plates and conditionally send alerts based on successful or unsuccessful operation, use App Insights to monitor the serverless topology, observing how well the solution scales when under load, and implement a Continuous Deployment DevOps process to automatically publish changes to Function Apps.
